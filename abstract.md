                                     Carbon Offset Landscapes for Data Centers
Abstract

Energy-intensive data centers have become critical and essential facilities for an increasingly digital world – crucial infrastructure for cloud computing, online services, and the computational capacity needed for rising AI demand and adoption. Accounting for approximately 0.5% of total US greenhouse gas emissions, US data centers emitted 105 million tons of CO2e between 2023-2024, with a carbon intensity 48% over the national average. This is only expected to increase, with a projected annual rise in the global demand for data center capacity of 19-22% between 2023 to 2030. Within large-scale, rural independent developments (classified as hyperscale data centers), data center building footprints comprise only 30-50% of site area – with the remaining 50-70% available for external applications, including ample opportunity for landscape buffers and stormwater ponds. Landscaping and green infrastructure serve a key role as natural carbon sinks and mechanisms for cooling and heat mitigation, with studies across urban planning, forestry management, and landscape architecture investigating the carbon sequestration potential of urban forests and indicating that the optimization of plant structural diversity and orientation can significantly increase the carbon sink ability of urban green spaces. We propose using machine learning to optimize species selection and organization of functionally diverse tree planting schemes to maximize the carbon sink capacity of landscape design within and surrounding hyperscale data center developments.

For this purpose we have researched and identified datasets with respect to various tree species and their carbon absorption metrics. We intend to use classification methods to identify the tree species which would be most appropriate given the geographical location and scale of the data center. We will also try to identify a rough figure of the number of trees required to offset the carbon emissions of the center. The following datasets have data which we can use for our project:
1. GLOWCAD

   a. Global Woody Tissue Carbon Concentration Database

   b. Link to access: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.18931zcxk

   c. Characteristics:

      i. 3,676 individual records of woody tissue C concentrations from 864 tree species

     ii. Woody tissue C concentration data is the mass of C per unit dry mass

    iii. We are equating this mass of C concentration with the carbon absorbed by the tree.

     iv. The dataset also contains the region and biome, along with the tree species
2. ReForesTree

   a. The main purpose is to show aerial images of reforestation sites and relevant details.

   b. However, the dataset also contains 4,664 entries of  various species of trees, along with their specifications and their carbon absorption metrics

   c. Link to access: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/qzlq48k06dbksvrl3kk1o/h?dl=0&e=1&preview=field_data.csv&rlkey=hpq3r63b1tbpqa02f5tyh8l6s

3. i-Tree Tools
 
   a. We are unable to find the dataset yet, but came across this tool as pretty useful for assessing and extracting tree data.
   
   b. Link to access: https://www.itreetools.org/ 
   
   c. It is comprehensive analysis of US tree canopy data and benefits of individual trees, including building interactions.

For this project, we intend to combine these datasets to build a comprehensive dataset focusing on carbon absorption of different trees and their relevant measurements. We will then use that combined dataset to use machine learning models for classifying the tree species most useful.
