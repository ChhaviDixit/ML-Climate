                                     Optimal Site Selection for Sustainable, Low-Impact Data Centers
Abstract

Energy-intensive data centers have become critical and essential facilities for an increasingly digital world – crucial infrastructure for cloud computing, online services, and the growing computational need for rising AI demand and adoption. In 2023–2024, U.S. data centers emitted an estimated 105 million tons of CO₂e — approximately 0.5% of national greenhouse gas emissions — with a carbon intensity 48% above the national average. This is only expected to increase, with global demand for data center capacity projected to grow 19-22% annually between 2023 to 2030. To mitigate environmental impact and infrastructure strain, we propose a machine learning framework to assess and optimize sustainable site selection for new U.S. data center developments. Our approach leverages feature engineering on datacenter environmental footprint datasets – training separate supervised models to predict key impact metrics of carbon, water intensity, and grid reliability (using PCA generation data as a proxy)  – to calculate a composite sustainability score for candidate sites based on (1) minimizing environmental harm and (2) maximizing operational efficiency. While ML and AI-assisted site planning and selection methods exist and are in use within commercial real estate development, construction, and urban spatial planning, current tools lack tailored metrics for the specific energy and environmental demands of hyperscale data centers. By providing a method for scaling these developments while minimizing environmental cost, this framework seeks to advance planning for more sustainable and resilient digital infrastructure.
