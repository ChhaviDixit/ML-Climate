                                       Carbon Offset Landscapes for Data Centers
Journal
1.	Week 1:

  a.	Together, we searched for more resources and found certain links of interest
  
     i.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629622002468
  	
     ii.	https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224123605_Thermodynamics_of_information_technology_data_centers – Thermodynamic profiles re: data centers

      vii.	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/1610427#:~:text=First%2C the k-means machine learning clustering method, landscaping required by modern urban landscape design & Artificial intelligence technology based on machine learning, some simple repetitive labor at this stage
    
      viii.	Considering water and energy utilization, a study conducted at the University of Vermont using spatially-detailed records of data centers proposed strategic methods for locating data centers to minimize one or more environmental footprints. - https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/484c56d7-9557-4c71-ad47-84ab67a21bad/content
  
  b.	We realized that we needed need to focus on species specific with carbon offset
  
  c.	Based on these resources, Chhavi identified three datasets and tool which we plan to combine for the project
  
    i.	GLOWCAD
    
    ii.	ReforesTree
    
    iii.	I-Tree Tools
  
  d. Together, we evaluated the datasets to assess feasibility and whether they matched our overall problem.
  e. Cate conducted background research on similar projects in urban planning/ML for a basic literature review, and drafted the abstract. Chhavi edited and added necessary technical details.
