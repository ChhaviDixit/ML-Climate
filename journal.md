      viii.	Considering water and energy utilization, a study conducted at the University of Vermont using spatially-detailed records of data centers proposed strategic methods for locating data centers to minimize one or more environmental footprints. - https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/484c56d7-9557-4c71-ad47-84ab67a21bad/content
  
  b.	We need to focus on species specific with carbon offset
  
  c.	Based on these resources, we have identified three datasets and tool which we plan to combine for the project
  
    i.	GLOWCAD
    
    ii.	ReforesTree
    
    iii.	I-Tree Tools
  
  d.  We have also created an initial draft of the abstract and uploaded in the repository.
